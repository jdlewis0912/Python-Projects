# Python EDA for Employee Wellbeing Dataset

This Jupyter notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about employee wellbeing, focusing on remote work conditions, mental health, and productivity. The analysis provides insights into various factors affecting employee satisfaction and performance in the workplace.

Key Steps in the Analysis:
1. Data Overview:

- Displays the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
- The dataset includes features such as Employee ID, Age, Gender, Job Role, Work Location, and several health and work-related metrics.

2. Summary Statistics:

- Provides descriptive statistics for the dataset, helping understand distributions of numerical variables.

3. Missing Data Handling:

- Identifies columns with missing values and addresses them by dropping rows with any missing data.

3. Data Cleaning:

- Removes duplicate rows to ensure clean data for analysis.

Dataset Information:
Columns: The dataset includes various employee metrics such as age, gender, job role, stress level, mental health conditions, work-life balance ratings, and more.
Missing Values: Some columns have missing values (e.g., Mental Health Condition and Physical Activity) which are handled during the data cleaning phase.
Requirements:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib (for potential visualization)
